<div id="answer-s6-3a" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not A.</strong> Substance B's angle of refraction is not identical to gelatin's.</p>

<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> All materials listed have optical densities lower than substance B's.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s6-3c" class="correct"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is C.</strong> Substance B has an angle of refraction higher than gelatin's; it slows light more than gelatin does, and must
have a higher refractive index.</p><p> This leaves only crown glass, sapphire, and diamond as possibilities in the table.</p>

<div id="answer-s6-4f" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not F.</strong> This would mean optical density decreases as the angle of refraction increases.</p>

<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> If you chose this answer, you may not have noticed that the different symbols on the graph key indicate the two separate materials.</p><p>Since each line follows a different pattern or trend, the water and the sand did not behave in the same way.

<div class="question">
	<div class="numcol">3.</div><p>Based on the specific heat table in Figure 3 and the results obtained in Figure 2, what is the relationship between specific heat and temperature change? </p>
	<p><a id="s7-3a" href="#" class="response">A.</a><span class="response">The lower the specific heat value of a substance, the greater the temperature changes when energy is applied from an external source.</span></p>

</div>
		
<div id="answer-s7-3a" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is A.</strong> The lower the specific heat value, the faster the temperature of the substance changes when energy is applied. The specific heat value of quartz sand in Figure 3 is 0.19cal/gram&deg;C compared to water at 1.00 cal/gram&deg;C. </p><p>The graph (Figure 2) indicates that sand increased temperature at a much faster rate compared to water in this experiment.</p><p>The relationship is inversely proportional between specific heat and temperature change.

</div>

<div id="answer-s7-3b" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> The relationship between specific heat and temperature change when energy is applied is not a direct relationship. </p><p>The highest specific heat value listed in Figure 3 is water. </p><p>However, water did not have the greatest change in temperature in the experiment after an external source of energy was applied. </p><p>Sand, with a lower specific heat value, had the greatest temperature changes. </p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s7-3c" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not C.</strong> Substances with low specific heat values do not require a lot of energy to change temperature. </p><p>The quartz sand had a specific heat of 0.19 cal/gram&deg;C (Fig. 3) and had a greater change in temperature compared to water (Fig. 2) with the same amount of energy. </p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s7-3d" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not D.</strong> Substances with high specific heat values retain heat for longer and require more energy to change the temperature of the substance. Water’s specific heat is 1.00 cal/gram&deg;C,which is higher compared to sand’s specific heat 0.19 cal/gram&deg;C (Fig. 3). </p><p>According to the experiment (Fig. 2), the water had a smaller change in temperature compared to sand when the same amount of external energy was applied. </p>

<div id="answer-s7-4f" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not F.</strong> Sandy clay has a specific heat of 0.33 cal/gram&deg;C (Fig.3). Since quartz sand has a specifc heat of 0.19 cal/gram&deg;C and water has a specific heat of 1.00 cal/gram&deg;C, & the sandy loam will behave closer to sand than water. </p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s7-4g" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not G.</strong> If the sandy clay would increase temperature at a slower rate compared to water, the specific heat value would be higher than water.</p><p> Water has a specific heat value of 1.00 cal/gram&deg;C and sandy clay has a specific heat value of 0.33cal/gram&deg;C (Fig. 3). </p><p>Sandy clay does not have a specific heat value greater than water. </p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s7-4h" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is  H.</strong> The specific heat of sandy clay is 0.33 cal/gram&deg;C, which is closer to the specific heat of quartz sand at 0.19 cal/gram&deg;C than it is to water (Fig. 3). The lower the value of specific heat, the faster the substance will change its temperature. </p><p>Since 0.33 is slightly larger than 0.19, the sandy clay will heat up slightly slower compared to the sand. </p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s7-4j" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not J.</strong> The higher specific heat values indicate the substance is able to retain its heat and does not change temperature as quickly (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The specific heat value of sandy clay is 0.33 cal/gram&deg;C, which is higher than quartz sand at 0.19 cal/gram&deg;C.

</div>
		
<div id="answer-s7-5a" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is A.</strong> The sand has a lower specific heat value and thus does not retain its heat effectively (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The sand temperature decreased at a faster rate compared to the water on the graph. </p><p>As the air temperature decreases to below freezing, the regions in close proximity to the sand will reach a lower temperature more quickly. </p>

<div id="answer-s7-5b" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> The water has a higher specific heat value and retains heat effectively (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The regions near water will not decrease temperature as fast as the regions near sand. </p>

<div id="answer-s7-5c" class="incorrect"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is not C.</strong> According to the experiment in Figure 2, sand and water did not behave in the same manner.

<p><strong>The best answer is not D.</strong> The sand and water did not behave the same in the experiment when the energy source remained constant (Fig. 2). </p><p>As shown in the experiment, if the air temperature pattern is the same for a region close to water and a region close to sand, the temperature of the two different surfaces will not remain the same. </p>
