<p><strong>The best answer is D.</strong> The writer uses the present tense to discuss Gladwell’s writing, beginning in the previous sentence (“Author Malcom Gladwell says &hellip;”). </p><p>There is no need to shift the tense to present-perfect (“has described”). The best choice is the present tense verb (“describes”). </p><p>Also, the most concise choice is best. Conciseness means using only as many words as necessary to get the point across.

	<p>The writer is considering deleting the following sentence at the end of Paragraph 1:</p>

</div>
<div id="answer-s1-2g" class="incorrect">

<p><strong>The best answer is not A.</strong> This choice is awkward and wordy. The infinitive phrase has the same meaning as the gerund phrase, but it sounds awkward and is not parallel with the gerund phrase <em>keeping it alive.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s1-9b" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is B.</strong> A gerund (the <em>–ing</em> form of a verb used as a noun) or gerund phrase is more frequently used at the beginning of a sentence because it sounds less awkward than an infinitive (the form of a verb preceded by <em>to</em>). This choice is also parallel with the gerund phrase <em>keeping it alive.</em> Of the choices given, the most direct and concise choice is best. All others are awkward and unnecessarily wordy. </p>

<div id="answer-s1-9c" class="incorrect">

<p><strong>The best answer is not D.</strong> This choice is awkward and wordy. It adds unnecessary words to the awkward infinitive clause used in the passage. It also changes the subject from the whole action (figuring out) to part of the action (beginning to figure out). </p>

<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> The second sentence in paragraph 2 focuses on the “Law of the Few,” or people with special social gifts and their role in starting fads.

</div>
<div id="answer-s1-15c" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not C.</strong> Paragraph 3 is about the Stickiness Factor, or the specific content of a message that makes it memorable. The new sentence gives three general examples of fads that have stuck, but it does not tell what made those items memorable. The new sentence does not give specific examples of the Stickiness Factor. </p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s1-15d" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not D.</strong> Paragraph 4 is the conclusion and asks the reader for ideas that could become <em>the next big thing.</em> The new sentence tells about fads of the past or present, not the future. </p>

<p>In the opening section, Ming and Sansan arrive in their new home feeling overwhelmed (paragraph 1) and afraid (paragraph 4), and wondering how they will adjust. Sansan says, “We’re getting old. How will we make the space in our minds for everything we’ll need to learn here?” Ming replies, “We will forget.” The rest of the passage builds to the final paragraph, which says that Ming envied how Charles could easily look to the past, that Ming sees the past as his enemy, and that his memories dog him.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s2-1b" class="incorrect">
<p>The focus of the passage is not really on Charles becoming an adult (he is still a few years away from that), and his parents are not very successful in remaining connected to their son. The father finds his son’s interests to be mysterious (paragraph 10) and has only brief glimpses into his son’s interests (paragraphs 10 and 11).</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s2-1c" class="correct"> 
<p>Though the passage does suggest that Sansan is nervous about adjusting to a new country (paragraphs 4 and 5), nothing is specifically mentioned about her trying to meet friends or maintain connections with family in China.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s2-1d" class="incorrect">
<p>Ming and Charles do not share many of the same interests. Ming feels that Charles’s interests are mysterious (paragraph 10). Ming likes science (paragraph 11), but Charles is drawn to the humanities (paragraph 9). When Charles asks Ming if he likes history, Ming says he can’t remember (paragraph 17).</p>

<p>The passage suggests the opposite, that the Hwangs put a large part of who they are behind them because they they think they need to do so in order to make room for all they will need to learn in their new lives (paragraphs 5, 6, 17 and 18).</p>
</div>

<p>Charles is so passionate about learning history that “He once failed to hear a fire drill bell while reading a biography of Thomas Paine.... He was drawn to the humanities and he seemed to be developing a passion for examining the past” (paragraph 9). He talks easily about history in paragraph 12. There are several hints that Ming finds the past difficult to talk about: “Ming did not know how to tackle this enormous question” about Chinese immigrants coming to the U.S. to work on the railroads (paragraph 13). When asked whether he liked history, “Ming stood and thought for a moment. ‘To tell you the truth,’ he said, ‘I can’t remember’” (paragraph 17). “He found himself envying the easy way that Charles reached for the past. How could he explain to his son that the past was his enemy? ...” (paragraph 18).</p>

<p>Though the father does suggest that the future will bring the family luck (paragraph 3), nothing in the passage suggests that Charles thinks their best days are behind them.</p>

<p>The passage suggests the opposite, that the Hwangs put a large part of who they are behind them because they they think they need to do so in order to make room for all they will need to learn in their new lives (paragraphs 5, 6, 17 and 18).</p>

<div id="answer-s3-1a" class="incorrect">
<p>In the opening section, Ming and Sansan arrive in their new home feeling overwhelmed (paragraph 1) and afraid (paragraph 4), and wondering how they will adjust. Sansan says, “We’re getting old. How will we make the space in our minds for everything we’ll need to learn here?” Ming replies, “We will forget.” The rest of the passage builds to the final paragraph, which says that Ming envied how Charles could easily look to the past, that Ming sees the past as his enemy, and that his memories dog him.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s3-1b" class="incorrect">
<p>The focus of the passage is not really on Charles becoming an adult (he is still a few years away from that), and his parents are not very successful in remaining connected to their son. The father finds his son’s interests to be mysterious (paragraph 10) and has only brief glimpses into his son’s interests (paragraphs 10 and 11).</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s3-1c" class="incorrect"> 
<p>Though the passage does suggest that Sansan is nervous about adjusting to a new country (paragraphs 4 and 5), nothing is specifically mentioned about her trying to meet friends or maintain connections with family in China.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s3-1d" class="correct">
<p>Ming and Charles do not share many of the same interests. Ming feels that Charles’s interests are mysterious (paragraph 10). Ming likes science (paragraph 11), but Charles is drawn to the humanities (paragraph 9). When Charles asks Ming if he likes history, Ming says he can’t remember (paragraph 17).</p>

<p>The passage suggests the opposite, that the Hwangs put a large part of who they are behind them because they they think they need to do so in order to make room for all they will need to learn in their new lives (paragraphs 5, 6, 17 and 18).</p>

</div>
<div id="answer-s3-2j" class="incorrect">
<p>Though a few minor comparisons may be implied in the passage, no detailed comparisons between the two countries are given. Instead, the Hwangs decided to forget their old lives in China, thinking they need to do so to make room for their new lives in the U.S. (paragraphs 5 and 6). </p>

<p>The father is interesting in learning. He and Sansan encourage their son’s learning by buying him a desk and school supplies. He also says he used to like to read the history of science and once loved science.</p>

<div id="answer-s3-3b" class="incorrect">
<p>Charles is so passionate about learning history that “He once failed to hear a fire drill bell while reading a biography of Thomas Paine.... He was drawn to the humanities and he seemed to be developing a passion for examining the past” (paragraph 9). He talks easily about history in paragraph 12. There are several hints that Ming finds the past difficult to talk about: “Ming did not know how to tackle this enormous question” about Chinese immigrants coming to the U.S. to work on the railroads (paragraph 13). When asked whether he liked history, “Ming stood and thought for a moment. ‘To tell you the truth,’ he said, ‘I can’t remember’” (paragraph 17). “He found himself envying the easy way that Charles reached for the past. How could he explain to his son that the past was his enemy? ...” (paragraph 18).</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s3-3c" class="incorrect"> 
<p>The father wants to talk with his son; he just finds it difficult to relate to him.</p>

<p>Besides a hope for good luck and thoughts about how the Hwangs will adjust, paragraphs 1 through 7 do not give much detail about their hopes and dreams.

<div id="answer-s4-1a" class="incorrect">
<p>In the opening section, Ming and Sansan arrive in their new home feeling overwhelmed (paragraph 1) and afraid (paragraph 4), and wondering how they will adjust. Sansan says, “We’re getting old. How will we make the space in our minds for everything we’ll need to learn here?” Ming replies, “We will forget.” The rest of the passage builds to the final paragraph, which says that Ming envied how Charles could easily look to the past, that Ming sees the past as his enemy, and that his memories dog him.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s4-1b" class="incorrect">
<p>The focus of the passage is not really on Charles becoming an adult (he is still a few years away from that), and his parents are not very successful in remaining connected to their son. The father finds his son’s interests to be mysterious (paragraph 10) and has only brief glimpses into his son’s interests (paragraphs 10 and 11).</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s4-1c" class="incorrect"> 
<p>Though the passage does suggest that Sansan is nervous about adjusting to a new country (paragraphs 4 and 5), nothing is specifically mentioned about her trying to meet friends or maintain connections with family in China.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s4-1d" class="correct">
<p>Ming and Charles do not share many of the same interests. Ming feels that Charles’s interests are mysterious (paragraph 10). Ming likes science (paragraph 11), but Charles is drawn to the humanities (paragraph 9). When Charles asks Ming if he likes history, Ming says he can’t remember (paragraph 17).</p>

<p>Charles is so passionate about learning history that “He once failed to hear a fire drill bell while reading a biography of Thomas Paine.... He was drawn to the humanities and he seemed to be developing a passion for examining the past” (paragraph 9). He talks easily about history in paragraph 12. There are several hints that Ming finds the past difficult to talk about: “Ming did not know how to tackle this enormous question” about Chinese immigrants coming to the U.S. to work on the railroads (paragraph 13). When asked whether he liked history, “Ming stood and thought for a moment. ‘To tell you the truth,’ he said, ‘I can’t remember’” (paragraph 17). “He found himself envying the easy way that Charles reached for the past. How could he explain to his son that the past was his enemy? ...” (paragraph 18).</p>

<p>In the opening section, Ming and Sansan arrive in their new home feeling overwhelmed (paragraph 1) and afraid (paragraph 4), and wondering how they will adjust. Sansan says, “We’re getting old. How will we make the space in our minds for everything we’ll need to learn here?” Ming replies, “We will forget.” The rest of the passage builds to the final paragraph, which says that Ming envied how Charles could easily look to the past, that Ming sees the past as his enemy, and that his memories dog him.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s5-1b" class="incorrect">
<p>The focus of the passage is not really on Charles becoming an adult (he is still a few years away from that), and his parents are not very successful in remaining connected to their son. The father finds his son’s interests to be mysterious (paragraph 10) and has only brief glimpses into his son’s interests (paragraphs 10 and 11).</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s5-1c" class="correct"> 
<p>Though the passage does suggest that Sansan is nervous about adjusting to a new country (paragraphs 4 and 5), nothing is specifically mentioned about her trying to meet friends or maintain connections with family in China.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer-s5-1d" class="incorrect">
<p>Ming and Charles do not share many of the same interests. Ming feels that Charles’s interests are mysterious (paragraph 10). Ming likes science (paragraph 11), but Charles is drawn to the humanities (paragraph 9). When Charles asks Ming if he likes history, Ming says he can’t remember (paragraph 17).</p>

<p>Charles is so passionate about learning history that “He once failed to hear a fire drill bell while reading a biography of Thomas Paine.... He was drawn to the humanities and he seemed to be developing a passion for examining the past” (paragraph 9). He talks easily about history in paragraph 12. There are several hints that Ming finds the past difficult to talk about: “Ming did not know how to tackle this enormous question” about Chinese immigrants coming to the U.S. to work on the railroads (paragraph 13). When asked whether he liked history, “Ming stood and thought for a moment. ‘To tell you the truth,’ he said, ‘I can’t remember’” (paragraph 17). “He found himself envying the easy way that Charles reached for the past. How could he explain to his son that the past was his enemy? ...” (paragraph 18).</p>
