			<tr><td><p class="readintro"><strong>PROSE FICTION:</strong> This passage is adapted from Lan Samantha Chang's short story "The Unforgetting," which appears in her story collection titled <em>Hunger</em>. Copyright © Lan Samantha Chang, 1998. In this story, Ming Hwang, his wife Sansan, and their son Charles are immigrants to the United States from China.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre><code>	On the summer day in 1967 when Ming Hwang first
saw the eastern Iowa hills, he pulled his car off
the road and stopped the engine. He felt
overwhelmed, as if he had arrived once more at the
sea that he had crossed to reach America and his
destiny lay again upon some faraway shore. The
neat, green fields rolled out to meet the sky. The
narrow strip of highway looked barely navigable.
Surely no Chinese man could ever have laid eyes
upon this place before.

	Beside him, Sansan stirred and squinted into the
hazy light. “This is beautiful,” she said. “Why
did you stop?”

	For a minute Ming could not reply. He wanted to
say, “This place has nothing to do with us.”
Instead, he pointed out the windshield. “Do you
see that water over there? That’s Mercy Lake. The
town is only a mile away.” He added, “Maybe it
will bring us luck.”

	When she didn’t answer, he turned to examine her
smooth, brown face and knew that she also was
afraid. He looked over his shoulder to make sure
that Charles was still asleep and would not hear
the conversation. “Is something wrong?” he asked.

	“We’re getting old,” she said. “How will we make
the space in our minds for everything we’ll need
to learn here?”

	Without a pause, he answered her, “We will
forget.”

	Sansan’s dark eyes flickered; then she nodded.
Ming glanced back again at his son. He turned
the key in the ignition and fixed his gaze upon
the road. 

&hellip;

	Charles’s English did improve. To Ming’s
surprise, he read all the time: after school, in
front of the television, on Saturday mornings,
over meals, and even, his teachers told Ming and
Sansan, during recess. In fifth grade, his
teachers were pleased. In sixth grade, they were
excited, and by the time he entered seventh grade,
his level of achievement was, they said,
phenomenal.

	Even more, the teachers said, he seemed to find a
pure pleasure in learning—an almost obsessive
pleasure. He once failed to hear a fire drill bell
while reading a biography of Thomas Paine. He
wrote his papers, they said, with such articulate
and righteous passion that his assignments more
than compensated for his lack of class
participation. He was drawn to the humanities and
he seemed to be developing a passion for examining
the past; he possessed a truly unusual mind.

	Why the humanities? Ming wondered. What intricate
foldings lay behind his son’s quiet face; what
opinions had formed beneath his stiff-mown hair?
The autumn of Charles’s eighth-grade year, Ming
bought him a wooden desk and a sturdy lamp with a
metal shade. He adjusted his chair and bolted a
steel pencil sharpener into the wall. Then he and
Sansan drove to the discount store and heaped a
shopping cart with blue spiral notebooks (his
favorite color) as well as blue pencils, a blue
cloth-covered binder, and an enormous blue eraser.
Charles brought these things to school in his
backpack, and after that, Ming glimpsed them only
now and then, evidence of his son’s mysterious
passions.

	One winter evening, while Charles was helping his
mother set the dining room table, Ming said, “I
think I understand your interest in history. I
used to like to read the history of science. I
used to love science.” He allowed his mind a
glimpse—only a glimpse—into the basement, through
the sliding panel of his desk, at the Handbook of
Chemistry and Physics. “Do you like science?”

	Charles looked up, the silverware clutched in his
hand. “Not really,” he said quickly. “But in
history, I learned about trains.” He began to talk
about the European and American-born pioneers who
had settled the land and made it into fields and
towns. Ming watched him gesture, still holding
their three forks in one brown hand, his wrists
grown out of his last year’s shirtsleeves. He
described how the use of trains had sped the
populating of the West, and how the
transcontinental railroad had been built by
Chinese immigrants. Then, to Ming’s dismay, he
asked, “Why was China so poor that people had to
come to the U.S. and work on the railroads?”

	Ming did not know how to tackle this enormous
question. “Well,” he said finally, “I’m not
certain of that, but the country has always been
poor.”

	“Why is that? Did you learn about it when you
were in school?”

	“We studied history.”

	“Did you like history?”

	Ming stood and thought for a moment. “To tell you
the truth,” he said, “I can’t remember.”

	That careful, lonely look came into Charles’s
face. He went into the kitchen and left Ming
standing at the table, regretting how he had ended
the conversation. He found himself envying the
easy way that Charles reached for the past. How
could he explain to his son that the past was his
enemy? That his memories dogged him, filled his
thoughts and plans with silt? They rose up in his
dreams, the way that in the spring the Mercy Lake
flooded through its margins, leaving the fishing
huts surrounded by water.</code></pre>

</div>

<div id="answer-s1-1a" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is A.</strong> In the opening section, Ming and Sansan arrive in their new home feeling overwhelmed (paragraph 1) and afraid (paragraph 4), and wondering how they will adjust. </p><p>Sansan says, “We’re getting old. How will we make the space in our minds for everything we’ll need to learn here?” </p><p>Ming replies, “We will forget.” </p><p>The rest of the passage builds to the final paragraph, which says that Ming envied how Charles could easily look to the past, that Ming sees the past as his enemy, and that his memories dog him.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-1b" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> The focus of the passage is not really on Charles becoming an adult (he is still a few years away from that), and his parents are not very successful in remaining connected to their son. </p><p>The father finds his son’s interests to be mysterious (paragraph 10) and has only brief glimpses into them (paragraphs 10 and 11).</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-1c" class="incorrect"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is not C.</strong> Though the passage does suggest that Sansan is nervous about adjusting to a new country (paragraphs 4 and 5), nothing is specifically mentioned about her trying to meet friends or maintain connections with family in China.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-1d" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not D.</strong> Ming and Charles do not share many of the same interests. </p><p>Ming feels that Charles’s interests are mysterious (paragraph 10). </p><p>Ming likes science (paragraph 11), but Charles is drawn to the humanities (paragraph 9). </p><p>When Charles asks Ming if he likes history, Ming says he can’t remember (paragraph 17).</p>

<div id="answer-s1-2f" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not F.</strong> In paragraphs 5 and 6, we see the Hwangs’ decision to forget, and the final two paragraphs show that Ming continues to work hard to forget his past.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-2g" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not G.</strong> The passage suggests the opposite, that the Hwangs put a large part of who they are behind them because they they think they need to do so in order to make room for all they will need to learn in their new lives (paragraphs 5, 6, 17 and 18).</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-2h" class="correct"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is H.</strong> See paragraphs 5 and 6: </p><p>“‘We’re getting old,’ [Sansan] said. ‘How will we make the space in our minds for everything we’ll need to learn here?’ </p><p>Without a pause, [Ming] answered her, ‘We will forget.’”</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-2j" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not J.</strong> Though a few minor comparisons may be implied in the passage, no detailed comparisons between the two countries are given. </p><p>Instead, the Hwangs decided to forget their old lives in China, thinking they need to do so to make room for their new lives in the U.S. (paragraphs 5 and 6). </p>

<div id="answer-s1-3a" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not A.</strong> The father is interested in learning. </p><p>He and Sansan encourage their son’s learning by buying him a desk and school supplies (lines 56&ndash;63). </p><p>He also says he used to like to read the history of science and once loved science (lines 70&ndash;72).</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-3b" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is B.</strong> Charles is so passionate about learning history that “He once failed to hear a fire drill bell while reading a biography of Thomas Paine &hellip;. </p><p>He was drawn to the humanities and he seemed to be developing a passion for examining the past” (paragraph 9). </p><p>He talks easily about history in paragraph 12. </p><p>There are several hints that Ming finds the past difficult to talk about: </p><p>“Ming did not know how to tackle this enormous question” about Chinese immigrants coming to the U.S. to work on the railroads (paragraph 13). </p><p>When asked whether he liked history, “Ming stood and thought for a moment. ‘To tell you the truth,’ he said, ‘I can’t remember’” (paragraph 17). </p><p>“He found himself envying the easy way that Charles reached for the past.

<div id="answer-s1-3c" class="incorrect"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is not C.</strong> The father wants to talk with his son; he just finds it difficult to relate to him.</p>

<div id="answer-s1-4f" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not F.</strong> Charles excels in school (paragraphs 8 and 9) rather than faces difficulty.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-4g" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is G.</strong> The first seven paragraphs tell about the Hwang family’s arrival in their new home in Iowa and reveals that they are immigrants from China. </p><p>Paragraphs 5 and 6 tell how Ming and Sansan plan to adjust to their new home.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-4h" class="incorrect"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is not H.</strong> Not much is revealed in the first seven paragraphs about Charles’s relationship with his parents. He is only a young child in the opening scene.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-4j" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not J.</strong> Besides a hope for good luck and thoughts about how the Hwangs will adjust, paragraphs 1 through 7 do not give much detail about their hopes and dreams.</p><p> Nothing in the passage tells about their aspirations changing over time. Their aspirations to adjust to their new lives and see their son succeed remain steady over time.</p>

<div class="question">
	<div class="numcol">5.</div><p>At the end of the passage, Mercy Lake serves as a metaphor for the:</p>

</div>

<div id="answer-s1-5a" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not A.</strong> The Mercy Lake metaphor does not describe Charles’s struggles but Ming’s thoughts about his past, which “rose up in his dreams” like a flooding lake.</p><p> Ming is the one who is seen struggling with his life in these closing lines of the passage, not his son.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-5b" class="incorrect">
<p><strong>The best answer is not B.</strong> In the last paragraph of the passage, Ming’s troubled thoughts are focused on his past, not any dreams he has about the future (which are not mentioned anyway). The lake metaphor is used to describe the way “his memories dogged him” and “flooded” his own thoughts and feelings.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-5c" class="incorrect"> 
<p><strong>The best answer is not C.</strong> The image of Mercy Lake overflowing “its margins” is used as a metaphorical description of Ming’s internal struggles and not to suggest some feeling of peacefulness that the family has found in their new home. In this scene, Ming is certainly not at peace, especially with his past.</p>
</div>

<div id="answer-s1-5d" class="correct">
<p><strong>The best answer is not D.</strong> See the last paragraph: “his memories dogged him … rose up in his dreams, the way that … Mercy Lake flooded through its margins….” The metaphor compares the way Ming’s troubling memories about his past figuratively flood his thoughts to the way Mercy Lake sometimes overflows its boundaries.</p>

			<tr><td><p class="readintro"><strong>SOCIAL SCIENCE:</strong> This passage is adapted from the introduction to a biography of Abraham Lincoln, by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Edited with the permission of Simon & Schuster, Inc., from TEAM OF RIVALS: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Copyright © 2005 by Blithedale Productions, Inc. All rights reserved.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre><code>	When [Abraham] Lincoln won the [Republican
presidential] nomination, each of his celebrated
rivals believed the wrong man had been chosen.
Ralph Waldo Emerson recalled his first reception
of the news that the “comparatively unknown name
of Lincoln” had been selected: “We heard the
result coldly and sadly. It seemed too rash, on a
purely local reputation, to build so grave a trust
in such anxious times.” 

	Lincoln seemed to have come from nowhere &mdash; a
backwoods lawyer who had served one
undistinguished term in the House of
Representatives and had lost two consecutive
contests for the U.S. Senate. Contemporaries and
historians alike have attributed his surprising
nomination to chance &mdash; the fact that he came from
the battleground state of Illinois and stood in
the center of his party. The comparative
perspective suggests a different interpretation.
When viewed against the failed efforts of his
rivals, it is clear that Lincoln won the
nomination because he was shrewdest and canniest
of them all. More accustomed to relying upon
himself to shape events, he took the greatest
control of the process leading up to the
nomination, displaying a fierce ambition, an
exceptional political acumen, and a wide range of
emotional strengths, forged in the crucible of
personal hardship, that took his unsuspecting
rivals by surprise. 

	That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made
the unprecedented decision to incorporate his
eminent rivals [for the nomination] into his
political family, the cabinet, was evidence of a
profound self-confidence and a first indication of
what would prove to others a most unexpected
greatness. [William H.] Seward became secretary of
state, [Salmon P.] Chase secretary of the
treasury, and [Edward] Bates attorney general. The
remaining top posts Lincoln offered to three
former Democrats &hellip; Gideon Welles, Lincoln’s
“Neptune,” was made secretary of the navy,
Montgomery Blair became postmaster general, and
Edwin M. Stanton, Lincoln’s “Mars,” eventually
became secretary of war. Every member of this
administration was better known, better educated,
and more experienced in public life than Lincoln.
Their presence in the cabinet might have
threatened to eclipse the obscure prairie lawyer
from Springfield. 

	It soon became clear, however, that Abraham
Lincoln would emerge the undisputed captain of
this most unusual cabinet, truly a team of rivals.
The powerful competitors who had originally
disdained Lincoln became colleagues who helped
him steer the country through its darkest days.
Seward was the first to appreciate Lincoln’s
remarkable talents, quickly realizing the futility
of his plan to relegate the president to a
figurehead role. In the months that followed,
Seward would become Lincoln’s closest friend and
advisor in the administration. Though Bates
initially viewed Lincoln as a well-meaning but
incompetent administrator, he eventually concluded
that the president was an unmatched leader, “very
near being a perfect man.” Edwin Stanton, who had
treated Lincoln with contempt at their initial
acquaintance, developed a great respect for the
commander in chief and was unable to control his
tears for weeks after the president’s death. Even
Chase, whose restless ambition for the presidency
was never realized, at last acknowledged that
Lincoln had outmaneuvered him.

	This, then, is a story of Lincoln’s political
genius revealed through his extraordinary array
of personal qualities that enabled him to form
friendships with men who had previously opposed
him; to repair injured feelings that, left
untended, might have escalated into permanent
hostility; to assume responsibility for the
failures of subordinates; to share credit with
ease; and to learn from mistakes. He possessed an
acute understanding of the sources of power
inherent in the presidency, an unparalleled
ability to keep his governing coalition intact, a
tough-minded appreciation of the need to protect
his presidential prerogatives, and a masterful
sense of timing. His success in dealing with the
strong egos of the men in his cabinet suggests
that in the hands of a truly great politician the
qualities we generally associate with decency and
morality &mdash; kindness, sensitivity, compassion,
honesty, and empathy &mdash; can also be impressive
political resources.

&hellip;

	As a young man, Lincoln worried that the “field
of glory” had been harvested by the founding
fathers, that nothing had been left for his
generation but modest ambitions. In the 1850s,
however, the wheel of history turned. The rising
intensity of the slavery issue and the
threatening dissolution of the nation itself
provided Lincoln and his colleagues with an
opportunity to save and improve the democracy
established by Washington, Jefferson, and Adams,
creating what Lincoln later called “a new birth
of freedom.” Without the march of events that led
to the Civil War, Lincoln still would have been a
good man, but most likely would never have been
publicly recognized as a great man. It was
history that gave him the opportunity to manifest
his greatness, providing the stage that allowed
him to shape and transform our national life.</code></pre>

			<tr><td><p class="readintro"><strong>HUMANITIES:</strong> The following excerpt is adapted from an interview with music critic Greil Marcus and historian Sean Wilentz, both of whom published books about the American folk musician Bob Dylan in 2010. “JM” is James Mustich, who is conducting the interview for BarnesandNobleReview.com, and “GM” is Greil Marcus.

<tr><td><pre><code>JM: When [Bob Dylan] first arrived on the scene,
he had a lot of fun trying to create a myth that
he had come out of nowhere like some kind of
hobo. But one of the interesting things in
reading both of you about him is the recognition
of how considered his education was, not only in
the music that he came to master, but also &mdash; in
your book particularly, Sean &mdash; in American history.
You spoke before about him going to the New York
Public Library to read microfilms of Civil
War-era newspapers.

And one of the most delightful pieces in Greil's
book is about his tour of Hibbing High School and
what he found there. Would you talk about that
for a little bit? 

GM: I was giving a reading in a bookstore in
Berkeley, and somebody asked the old question,
"How does Bob Dylan come out of a nowhere town
like Hibbing?" This woman stood up, and she was
absolutely outraged. She said, "Has anyone here
ever been to Hibbing?" Nobody had. She said,
"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You
don't know what you're talking about. This is a
town steeped in radical traditions, as every town
in the Iron Range has been for a hundred years.
This is a town with poetry on the walls, and
arguments going on in the streets that people
have been having between Wobblies and Communists
and Socialists and Social Democrats for a hundred
years, and this is the world Bob Dylan came out
of."

So we were there fast. [LAUGHS] We had to see for
ourselves. The shock for me, the first shock, was
seeing Hibbing High School. I went to a high
school that was built in 1951. It was a modern,
suburban California high school, a pretty
good-looking place-and it was a shack, compared
to Hibbing High, which opened in 1924. Hibbing
High School is absolutely enormous. It's the
most impressive public building I've ever seen
outside of Washington, D.C. When Harry Truman met
the head of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who was
from Hibbing, he said, "Oh, I know Hibbing;
that's the place where the high school has gold
doorknobs." &hellip; It has a legendary auditorium,
which is not like a high school auditorium &mdash; it's
like a great opera house. That's one of the
stages where Bob Dylan first performed, and you
can imagine him up on that stage and seeing not
just his high school classmates in the audience,
but the whole world before him.

But the most unusual and the most striking thing
about our trip to Hibbing High was that during a
tour the next day, an organized tour, B. J.
Ralston, who had been Bob Dylan's high school
English teacher, was there. He was then in his
eighties and he was feeble, but with a completely
clear mind. He sat in his old English classroom
where he had taught Bob Dylan. Forty or so people
crowded into the room, and the notion was we were
going to hear him reminisce about Robert-Robert
Zimmerman [Dylan’s given name]. He mentioned a
couple of things. He mentioned that Robert always
sat in the seat directly in front of the podium
from which he lectured, and he quoted a Bob Dylan
song about "You gotta sit up near the teacher if
you want to learn anything," and he was full of
pride about that. That was five minutes. But then
for the next 20 minutes, he taught a class in
poetry to the 40 visitors there. There were many
poems he discussed. But he kept returning to
"The Red Wheelbarrow" by William Carlos
Williams. He approached that poem from so many
different angles, from so many different points
of view, putting an emphasis on one word (there
are very, very few words in this poem), putting
all the weight on another word (it might be
"chicken," it might be "red," it might be
"rain"), and then opening up the poem as if it
were a flower in high speed film.

Forget about the grandeur of the high school.
Forget about the magnificence of the auditorium.
Think about how rare it is for anyone to
encounter a teacher who can do those kinds of
things, who can open you up to the notion that
there is an infinite amount of meaning and
possibility and inspiration in the smallest thing
before you. That's what this teacher could do.
That was the poetry on the walls. Yes, there is
literally poetry chiseled on the walls of Hibbing
High School, from Wordsworth and any number of
other people, and it's pretty great stuff. But
this was a different kind of poetry.</code></pre>

			<tr><td><p class="readintro"><strong>NATURAL SCIENCE:</strong> This passage is adapted from an article by Michael Shermer titled “When Scientists Sin,” from the July 2010 issue of <em>Scientific American</em>.  Reproduced with permission. Copyright (C) 2010 Scientific American, a division of Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre><code>	In his 1974 commencement speech at the California
Institute of Technology, Nobel laureate physicist
Richard P. Feynman articulated the foundation of
scientific integrity: “The first principle is that
you must not fool yourself-and you are the easiest
person to fool. After you’ve not fooled
yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists.
You just have to be honest in a conventional way
after that.” 

	Unfortunately, says Feynman’s Caltech colleague
David Goodstein in his new book <em>On Fact and Fraud:</em>
<em>Cautionary Tales from the Front Lines of Science</em>
(Princeton University Press, 2010), some
scientists do try to fool their colleagues, and
believing that everyone is conventionally honest
may make a person more likely to be duped by
deliberate fraud. Nature may be subtle, but she
does not intentionally lie. People do. <em>Why</em> some
scientists lie is what Goodstein wants to
understand. He begins by debunking myths about
science such as: “A scientist should never be
motivated to do science for personal gain,
advancement or other rewards.” “Scientists should
always be objective and impartial when gathering
data.” “Scientists must never believe dogmatically
in an idea or use rhetorical exaggeration in
promoting it.” “Scientists should never permit
their judgments to be affected by authority.”
These and many other maxims just do not reflect
how science works in practice. 

	Knowing that scientists are highly motivated by
status and rewards, that they are no more
objective than professionals in other fields, that
they can dogmatically defend an idea no less
vehemently than ideologues and that they can fall
sway to the pull of authority allows us to
understand that, in Goodstein’s assessment,
“injecting falsehoods into the body of science is
rarely, if ever, the purpose of those who
perpetrate fraud. They almost always believe that
they are injecting a truth into the scientific
record.” Goodstein should know because his job as
the vice provost of Caltech was to investigate
allegations of scientific misconduct. From his
investigations Goodstein found three risk factors
present in nearly all cases of scientific fraud.
The perpetrators, he writes, “1. Were under career
pressure; 2. Knew, or thought they knew, what the
answer to the problem they were considering would
turn out to be if they went to all the trouble of
doing the work properly; and 3. Were working in a
field where individual experiments are not
expected to be precisely reproducible.” 

	To detect fraud, we must first define it, and
Goodstein does: “Research misconduct is defined as
fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in
proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or
in reporting research results.” Next there must
“be significant departure from accepted practices
of the scientific community.” Then, the misconduct
must be “committed intentionally, or knowingly, or
in reckless disregard of accepted practices,” and
finally, as in any court of law, the fraud charge
must be proved by a preponderance of evidence. 

	Clear-cut cases of fraud include the twin studies
of British psychologist Cyril L. Burt (who faked
so many twins that he had to fabricate additional
twin researchers), the Sloan-Kettering Institute
cancer researcher William Summerlin’s experiments
on inducing healthy black skin grafts on white
mice (which he was caught enhancing with a black
felt-tipped pen), physicist Victor Ninov’s alleged
discovery of element 118 (predicted by others so
he faked data for its existence), and of course
the famous Piltdown Man hoax (which turned out to
be the jaw of an orangutan dyed to look old).
Other cases are not so clear. Martin Fleischmann
and Stanley Pons’s “discovery” of cold fusion,
Goodstein concludes, was most likely a case of
scientists who “convince themselves that they are
in the possession of knowledge that does not in
fact exist.” This self-deception is distinctly
different from deliberate deception. 

	So some scientists sin, it’s true. Given the
fiercely competitive nature of research funding
and the hardscrabble intensity of scientific
status seeking, it is surprising that fraud isn’t
more rampant. The reason that it is so rare
(compared with, say, corruption in politics) is
that science is designed to detect deception (of
one’s self and others) through colleague
collaboration, graduate student mentoring, peer
review, experimental corroboration and results
replication. The general environment of openness
and honesty, though mythic in its idealized form,
nonetheless exists and in the long run weeds out
the cheats and exposes frauds and hoaxes, as
history has demonstrated.</code></pre>
